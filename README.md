# simple_shell

The aim is to create a simple UNIX command interpreter.

# Technologies

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

# Compilation

It compiled this way:

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o shell`

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in C and shell:

| Filename              | Description
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
| `main.c`              | creates a simple UNIX command interpreter.
| `main.h`              | header file includes libraries, structures, and the prototypes of all functions used for this  project.
| `_prompt.c`           | reads a line from standard input.
| `_split_line.c`       | splits line to array of words.
| `_execute.c`          | executes a command entered by the user in the shell.
| `_print.c`            | prints a string.
| `_string_functions.c` | contains all not allowed string library functions.
| `_assist_functions.c` | contains all not allowed system calls and other functions.
| `_getline_.c`         | reads an entire line from a stream.
| `generate-authors.sh` | lists all contributors to the repository.
| `AUTHORS`             | generated by generate-authors.sh, DO NOT EDIT.
| `_check_path.c`       | checks if a command exists in one of the directories in the PATH environment variable.
| `_cmd_type.c`         | determines the type of a command.
| `_getenv.c`           | retrieves the value of an environment variable given its name.
